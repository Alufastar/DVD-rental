### Description
This project includes a SQL script to retrieve data from an open relational database.
The retrieve results are used for data visualization together with further analysis.

### Files used
MySQL's Sample Salika (DVD Rental) - Database http://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/index.html
The Sakila sample database was initially developed by Mike Hillyer, a former member of the MySQL AB documentation team. It is intended to provide a standard schema that can be used for examples in books, tutorials, articles, samples, and so forth. The Sakila sample database also serves to highlight features of MySQL such as Views, Stored Procedures, and Triggers.
